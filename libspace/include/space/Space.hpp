 * The space class handles instantiating services and shifting messages around between services
 * Role as a MessageService:
 * Specifically if the object id is not availabe in active mObjectConnections, mObjectConnections will 
 * forward the message back to the space so the space can try the builtin services and then eventually the
 * mRouter (to shift it to another space node which may have the connection)
 * 
 * Each space has an ID and right now the space is designed to run in a single thread and be waiting on the mIO service
